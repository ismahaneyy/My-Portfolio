# Ismahan's Portfolio 

Hey there! Welcome to my portfolio website. I'm Ismahan, a Computer Science student who's absolutely passionate about web development and building cool stuff that makes a difference.

## What You'll Find Here

This is my personal portfolio where I showcase the projects I've been working on, from my early days at Moringa School to the exciting things I'm building now. It's built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript - keeping things clean and fast.

## My Journey So Far

My coding journey started at **Moringa School** where I dove deep into real web development projects. That experience completely changed how I saw technology - it wasn't just about learning syntax, it was about solving real problems and building things that matter.

Now I'm pursuing a Computer Science degree at **Riara University** to strengthen my technical foundation. But honestly, the best learning happens when you're building actual projects, and that's exactly what I love doing.

## What I'm Working With

I'm comfortable with the modern web development stack:
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Supabase
- **Version Control**: Git, GitHub
- **Tools**: Vite, VS Code Extensions, Browser Extensions
- **AI**: Prompt AI integration (it's pretty amazing what you can build with it!)

## Featured Projects

### Group Projects
- **Gawa** - A food sharing app where I worked on the frontend. It's all about making fast food more affordable and social.
- **Rebirth of a Queen** - My backend work on a platform celebrating African heritage through storytelling.
- **BreakBuddy** - A productivity app that won the Judges' Favourite Award at a hackathon!

### Individual Projects
- **TaskManager** - A clean productivity app built with React, Supabase, and some AI magic
- **Issy Blog Extension** - A VS Code extension that brings RSS feeds right into your coding environment
- **Edge Accessibility Helper** - A browser extension that makes web content more accessible

## Why I Love What I Do

There's something incredibly satisfying about turning an idea into something people can actually use. Whether it's helping someone stay organized with a task manager or making web content more accessible, I love that coding lets me solve real problems.

I'm always curious about new technologies and love challenging myself with projects that push me to learn something new. That's probably why I've dabbled in everything from traditional web apps to VS Code extensions and browser plugins.
